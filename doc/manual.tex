\section{Description}
In an abstracted form, images are matrices of color values. Therefore, we can
perform linear algebra operations on images just as we do on general matrices.
Specifically, when we perform a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on an image,
we can represent it as the product of 3 matrices: the left-singular vectors,
a diagonal matrix of the decreasing singular values and the right-singular vectors.

\begin{equation}
A=USV^{T}
\end{equation}

Performing an SVD gets interesting for images when we truncate the factor
matrices. Truncation in this sense is the removal of a certain number of
trailing columns of $U$ and $V$ and trailing columns and rows of $S$. By
multiplying the matrix back into $A$ after truncating, we get back a similar
image to the original. Depending on the amount of truncation, we can keep a
``good'' representation of the image in less space! 

\svdimage is a program and developer library that performs a truncated SVD. It
is written in the Ruby programming language and provides a command line
interface.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item Command Line Interface
\item Grayscale, RGB, and CMYK channel processing
\item Level of truncation can be ``automatic'' or user-specified
\item Supports most image file formats
\item Codec provides targeted file format (.svd)
\item Ruby Gem distribution
\item Can be used a library
\end{itemize}

\section{Compression}
The main application of \svdimage is to compress images. However, this does not
come for free. We are indeed losing information about the original image. This
happens by reducing the rank our image to some value. For example, an image
\texttt{dog.jpg}may have 200 linearly independent rows and columns. If we run
\svdimage on this image with a k value of 150, the output will be an image that
looks similar to \texttt{dog.jpg}, but is acutally now comprised of 150 linearly
independent rows and columns. In other words, 50 rows and columns will be the
linear combination of the other 150 rows and columns. 

Another caveat is that you may not always notice compression in file size. This
is dependent on a few factors (image content, colorspace, file format). Not each
file format stores truncated SVDs in a way optimal to this operation. I can't
imagine a file format that would be able to understand if some rows or columns
are linearly dependent.

However, this is not to say you will never see compression! Personally, most
times, I have.

\section{Sigma Ratio Threshold}
\svdimage comes with the option to use the \texttt{-a}/\texttt{--auto-k} flags.
These tell \svdimage that you would like to try to find a good truncation
automatically. This truncation is unique to to the image's singular values and
the sigma threshold. First, we set our sigma threshold equal to some value. By
default, \svdimage uses 0.2, but you may also specify this yourself by providing
an argument to the \texttt{-a}/\texttt{--auto-k} flags. Here is psuedocode for
the algorithm:

%algorithmic doesn't like \operatorname
\begin{algorithmic}
  \Require $0 \leq \operatorname{sigma\_threshold} < 1$
  \For{$k = 1 \to \operatorname{k\_max}$}
    \If{$ \operatorname{sigma\_threshold} \geq \frac{\sum_{i=k+1}^{t} \sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{t} \sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2}}}$}
      \Return $k$
    \EndIf
  \EndFor
\end{algorithmic}

Intuitively, you may think of this as leaving out
$(\operatorname{sigma\_threshold})\%$ of the image's information.

\section{Question}
The project poses a question:
\begin{quote}
To get a good easily recognizable image, do you need to have $\sigma_{k+1}$ small
compares to 255, or just small compared to $\sigma_1$, or is there some other criterion of smallness
that is even more relevant?
Try this compression with portraits of faces. How small can you make k, and still
keep the portrait recognizable? In other words (roughly), what is the rank of a human
face?
\end{quote}

I believe I have answered this question with my explanation of the sigma ratio
threshold. A good $k$ is not dependent on 255 or just being small, but it is
instead dependent on the complexity of the image. $k$ must be chosen such that
you do not lose too much information from the image.
